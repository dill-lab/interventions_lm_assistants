## About
In this work, we facilitate data-driven insights from the NVDRS data to support the development of novel suicide interventions by investigating the value of language models (LMs) as efficient assistants to these (a) data annotators and (b) experts. We introduce a human-in-the-loop algorithm to assist experts in efficiently building and refining guidelines for annotating new variables by allowing them to focus only on providing feedback for incorrect LM predictions. 

<!-- ## Getting Started
* Install the recommended dependencies via [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
  ```bash
    conda create -n oath python=3.9.12
    conda activate oath
    conda install -c conda-forge pip # make sure pip is installed
    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt # make sure the packages are installed in the specific conda environment
    python -m pip install -e .
  ``` -->

## Human-in-the-loop Codebook Development Algorithm
Coming Soon!
